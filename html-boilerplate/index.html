            We can add comments like any other proggramming language using the ! tag this tag starts with ! and have 2 dashes -- and ends with 2 dashes yeah bit kina
            weird but nothing much can be done just use it faster wit the help of a code editor. in VS we can use the iconnic ctrl and / and make the text a comment like we 
            do in other progg language
        
        </p>
        <!-- Do not use b and i tags for bold and intalic as 
            these doesnt give emphasis and importance to the screen
             readers the hust do the thing but doesnt give importance
              to the device -->
        <strong>checking the strong tag</strong> 
        <!-- makes the text bold and indicates its important for the screen readers -->
        <em>
            Checking for the emphasis on the text / or italic
        </em> <!-- comment syntax-->
